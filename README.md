# Public Sentiment and Unemployment Rates - A Causal Inference Analysis Across American States  
## Mock Results  
1.	Expected results of the national trend 
Chart description:
Char type: Line graph
X-axis: Time axis from 2013 to 2018
Y-axis: Dual-axis, one for sentiment score representing public attitudes, one for unemployment rates
Expected results: There is a generally negative correlation between public attitudes and unemployment rates. The public tends to have a negative attitude when facing a bad economic situation with a relatively higher unemployment rate, and there would be a high sentiment score when there is a lower unemployment rate. Moreover, for example, in 2015, suppose a significant national event may have led to a temporary drop in sentiment nationwide. Still, the unemployment rate did not change significantly due to its short-lived impact.
2.	Expected results of state comparison
Char Description:
Char type: Scatterplot sets, one chart per state
X-axis: Time axis
Y-axis: Public sentiments and unemployment rates
General expected results: Different states might have different trends, but most states would have negative correlations.
Expected results for specific states: Alaska's economy depends on oil, gas, fishing, and tourism, and its remote geographic location and extreme weather conditions limit the diversification of economic activities. Because of their high resilience to economic fluctuations and diverse lifestyles, residents may show a positive or essentially no relationship between public sentiment and unemployment rates.
3.	Expected results of statistical significance and regression results
Display contents:
National model: regression analysis of the national data, including the coefficient of the effect of public attitudes on the unemployment rate, p-value, confidence interval, and R square value
State-level model: regression analysis of each state, reflecting state-wise differences
Expected results:
National model: high R square and p-value < 0.01, shows high explanatory power that negative relationship between public sentiments and unemployment rates.
State-level model: The impact of public attitudes on the coefficient and statistical significance in different states are different. For example, tech-driven states may show a stronger correlation, while traditional manufacturing states have a weaker correlation.
